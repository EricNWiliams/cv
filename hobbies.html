        One of my favorite hobbies is skateboarding. I started riding a skateboard when I was 14 and haven't stopped since.
          I enjoy capturing photos and videos of friends and I skateboarding. Here's a link to a short
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqLuU92ALYA">video</a>
          I made at my local skatepark.

        I am a huge fan of movies. I watch all types from black and white classics to modern sci-fi epics, and I am obsessive
        about learning movie directors. I think watching a movie without knowing the director is like reading a book without
        knowing the author! I also like to film and edit videos. While attending UTD I took a course in Geoscience Animations
        where we created a five minute educational YouTube video on a topic in Geology. My Video

        won first prize at our annual Geoscience Animations contest. The following summer I accepted a position working for the

        There I worked on two more projects:
