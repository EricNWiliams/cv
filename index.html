      <p>I am a recent graduate from The University of Texas at Dallas with a B.S. in Geosciences. I am aslo an aspiring web developer. I started studying Geology at UTD in 2015
        and will be graduating with a B.S. in the summer of 2020. Prior to that I spent nearly ten years working in various industries from 2006 – 2015. And prior to that I graduated
        from high school in 2006. </p>
        <p>I decided to start studying geology after spending five years working in the debt collection industry.I enjoyed my work at first, but after a while the appeal began to wear thin.
           I was bored from working at a desk all day and sick of collecting debts. However, my experience with various debts, particularly student loan debts, helped me realize I could
           afford to go to school and not work a full-time job. </p>
        <p>With this knowledge I quit my job, took out student loans and enrolled at UTD. I knew I wanted to study a science. I chose one that was as different from my previous work as I
          could find, geology. For the last four years I have traveled from mountains to deserts studying earth and rock science. Now that I am nearing graduation, I don’t know what I am
          going to do next, but it sure has been a lot of fun. </p>

        One of my favorite hobbies is skateboarding. I started riding a skateboard when I was 14 and haven't stopped since.
          I enjoy capturing photos and videos of friends and I skateboarding. Here's a link to a short
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqLuU92ALYA">video</a>
          I made at my local skatepark.

        I am a huge fan of movies. I watch all types from black and white classics to modern sci-fi epics, and I am obsessive
        about learning movie directors. I think watching a movie without knowing the director is like reading a book without
        knowing the author! I also like to film and edit videos. While attending UTD I took a course in Geoscience Animations
        where we created a five minute educational YouTube video on a topic in Geology. My Video
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AVaPqObNaY&amp;t=12s"><em>Age of the Earth</em></a>
        won first prize at our annual Geoscience Animations contest. The following summer I accepted a position working for the
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGRcGfZpcWMCihRgpCrjXFA">UTD Geoscience Studio.</a>
        There I worked on two more projects:
